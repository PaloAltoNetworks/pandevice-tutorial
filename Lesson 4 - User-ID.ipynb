Such external systems might include an Active Directory Server, Wireless AP Controller, Virtual Desktop Manager, Virtualization Orchestrator, or AWS Public Cloud. The API is used for systems that are not natively supported, such as a proprietary app, non-standard Radius server, or VPN concentrator. You can send updates to the firewall from these system using the User-ID API. Device Framework makes this very easy."

    "## Dynamic Address Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic Address Groups are a powerful tool for enforcing security policy. They allow the firewall's security policy to be dynamically kept up-to-date with knowledge from external systems such as orchestration, virtualization, cloud, IPAM, NAC, and other tools. For example, the firwall natively supports pulling metadata about virtual machines from VMware vCenter and AWS. There are also integrations with OpenStack, Cisco ACI, and many others to gather metadata for policy use. The firewall is aware of the guest OS, UUID, name, and purpose of the virtual machines so you can create policy based on these attributes, instead of IP addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also add metadata to the firewall using the API. This is useful in cases where the orchestration tool isn't already integrated with the firewall, or you want to build security policy on additional information not natively supported such as tenant metadata shared to the firewall.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two parts to a Dynamic Address Group:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Dynamic Address Group and match criteria\n",
    "2. The Registered IP and tag table\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Dynamic Address Group** and match criteria is just like a regular Address Group, but instead of giving it a list of IP addresses, you give it a match criteria consisting of tags.  For example, a dynamic address group might match on: `'newyork' AND 'linux' AND 'web'` indicating that the IP addresses in this address group are linux-based web servers located in New York. You can now use this address group in a policy, and whenever a new linux web server is spun up in New York, it will automatically be part of this address group.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Registered IP and tag table** is a table in the firewall similar to the User to IP mapping table, but instead of mapping IPs to users, it maps IPs to tags. These tags are the same tags used in the match criteria in the Dynamic Address Group. So if we follow the same example, any IP address registered with all 3 tags ('newyork', 'linux' and 'web') will be included in the linux New York web server Dynamic Address Group.\n",
