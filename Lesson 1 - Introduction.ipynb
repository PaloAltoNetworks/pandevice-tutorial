    "The Palo Alto Networks **Device Framework** is is a powerful tool to create automations and interactions with PAN-OS devices including Next-generation Firewalls and Panorama. It is a **python library** intended to be simple enough for non-programmers to use to **create complex and sophisticated automations** that leverage the PAN-OS API. The Device Framework offers an **object-oriented model** of the firewall and Panorama configuration to provide an automation framework that is conceptually similar to interaction with the device via the GUI or CLI. Available on PyPi and GitHub, it is easy to get started and create fully custom automation scripts.\n",
